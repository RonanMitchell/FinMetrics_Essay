# Introduction

## Calculation of Yield

The assessment of bond profitability differs from that of equities and other risky assets. Financial practitioners often use the term "yield" in order to contextualize bond profitability. This can take various forms; Current Yield, Yield-to-Call, Yield-to-Worst, and Yield-to-Maturity (YTM). The widely adopted practice involves employing YTM to calculate yield spreads, as is the case in this paper. As in Lawrence & Shankar (2007:92), the relationship between a bind price and YTM is calculated as: 

\[ P = \frac{C}{(1+i)} + \frac{C}{(1+i)^2} + \ldots + \frac{M}{(1+i)^n} \]

Where *P* is the price of the bond, *C* is the coupon rate, *M* is the principal payment, and *i* - which can be inferred) - is the YTM. From this, it can be concluded that, *ceteris paribus*, there is an inverse relationship between the price and yield of a bond. A core assumption of this formula is that it assumes the bond buyer will hold until maturity and reinvest each interest payment at the same interest rate. It is simply an estimate of one can expect to earn from purchasing a given bond. 


It is sometimes approximated as:

\[ YTM \approx \frac{C + \frac{FV - PV}{n}}{\frac{FV + PV}{2}} \]

In this case, the *FV* is the face value of the security and the *PV* would be the present value or price of the security. 

## Implications of Yield 

Yield: Analysts usually refer to yield-to-maturity of a risky bond as a comparable measure of value. The yield itself can be split in two major components: the risk-free rate and the risk premium. While the risk-free rate only refers to time preferences, the risk premium includes many factors. The risk premium is indeed the additional increment in the yield that is supposed to compensate the investor for bearing different types of risk (credit or default, liquidity risk, exchange rate risk) as well as to compensate for different taxation treatments and/or marketability conditions. Accordingly, both the theoretical and empirical literature in finance has regarded differences in yield to maturity of two separate bonds, with same characteristics, as a measure of the incremental risk of one over the other (Lo Conte, 2009:344). 

In theory, the spread between two assets with identical cash flows should be zero only if the two assets in question have identical risk-return characteristics (Manganelli & Wolswijk, 2009:203). 

For private and corporate sectors, government securities often represent
the benchmark to price fixed-income securities, but they are also frequently used for hedging interest rate risk or simply as a risk-free investment
as collateral. Government securities are the most relevant channel for developing internal financial market (Lo Conte, 2009:341). 

US Government bonds are widely considered to be the world's safe store of value (He, Krishnamurthy, & Milbradt, 2016:519). 

Investors share a common but changing risk appetite. They do not need to have a single preference function or a continuously changing one but given certain exogenous conditions, the appetite for risk may fall in two distinct states: risk adverse and risk loving. In the good times (risk loving) investors increase the demand for risky assets the value of which rise significantly; in bad time (risk averse) investors reduce their exposure to risky assets and their value fall. In this process of re-balancing the international
portfolio in terms of risk and liquidity requirements, investors transfer their
modified perceptions of risk from one country to another regardless the
share of common macroeconomic fundamentals giving rise to the phenomenon of contagion commonly observed. This is further strengthened by the
evidence that investors in emerging markets are common across countries
and therefore it is natural to expect that a crisis in a country leads to high-
er yield spreads in the surrounding areas (Lo Conte, 2009:351). 

In the financial risk literature, time-varying risk-aversion is often explained as being a function of the general state of the economy (Manganelli & Wolswijk, 2009:203). 

Often, they are a large component of safe asset portfolios, such as those of a central bank (He, Krishnamurthy, & Milbradt, 2016:519). 

The surge of sovereign bond issues in emerging economies has been impressive. From negligible levels in 1980s ($3.5 billion in 1989), the amount
of bonds issued by developing countries reached $102 billion in 1996 (Lo Conte, 2009:342). 

The large demands for safe US Treasury bills leads to low yields (He *et al.*, 2016:519).

US Government debt to GDP has risen substantially over the last decade, but bond yields have not been reflective of this additional risk (He *et al.*, 2016:519).

The size of total public debt relative to domestic GDP turns out to be a comprehensive measure of risk. In almost all studies, liquidity and credit risk are found to be significant determinants of EU yield differentials (Lo Conte, 2009:343). 

Liquidity, it is claimed by practitioners, is the main source of the residual segmentation among European government bonds, but the evidence does not fully support this view (Lo Conte, 2009:366). 

The authors claim that the reason for the above is only because investors have nowhere else to go (He *et al.*, 2016:519).

They build a model to demonstrate that the "safety" of an asset is determined by investors; essentially, they argue that safety is endogenous and that investors actions can make an asset safer than some other macroeconomic indicators would suggest (He *et al.*, 2016:523).

Inflation or debt-to-GDP, for example, would not explain fully yield differentials in developing regions bonds. In particular, correct measurement of credit risk needs to quantify the extent to which a developing country is able to meet payments in U.S. dollars either via generation of trade surplus or
through the use of its foreign currency reserves. (Lo Conte, 2009:343). 

# Descriptive Statistics

## Bond Yields 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yields of Developed Nations \\label{Figure1.1}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "53%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Developed_Bond_Yields.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

Yield differentials among members of the EU have converged
dramatically since 1999 although they have not completely disappeared. The
introduction of the common currency in 1999 eliminated the exchange rate
risk component of the spreads leaving credit risk and liquidity risk as the on-ly residual sources of market segmentation (Lo Conte, 342:2009).
