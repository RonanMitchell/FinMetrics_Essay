# Introduction 

# Literature Review 

## The Calculation of Bond Yield

The assessment of bond profitability differs markedly from the evaluation of equities and other risky assets. Financial analysts often use the term "yield" in order to contextualize bond performance. This can take various forms; Current Yield, Yield-to-Call, Yield-to-Worst, and Yield-to-Maturity (YTM). The widely adopted practice in finance involves employing YTM to calculate yield spreads, as is the case in this paper. In Lawrence & Shankar (2007:92), the relationship between a bond price and YTM is calculated as: 

\[ P = \frac{C}{(1+i)} + \frac{C}{(1+i)^2} + \ldots + \frac{M}{(1+i)^n} \]

In the above equation, *P* is the price of the given bond, *C* is the coupon rate, *M* is the principal payment, and *i* - which can be inferred - is the YTM. From this, it can be concluded that, *ceteris paribus*, there is an inverse relationship between the price of a bond and the YTM. A core assumption of this formula is that the bond buyer will hold until maturity and reinvest each interest payment at the same rate. It is simply an estimate of what one should earn from purchasing a bond. The YTM is often approximated as:

\[ YTM \approx \frac{C + \frac{FV - PV}{n}}{\frac{FV + PV}{2}} \]

In this case, the *FV* is the face value of the security and the *PV* would be the present value or price of the security. This equation once again demonstrates the inverse relationship between the price and yield of a bond. This relationship is a useful tool for understanding why bond yields are a good indicator of implied risk in the economy, and this is elaborated on in the subsequent section. The calculated yield is often used to differentiate between the risk profiles of two or more bonds. 

## The Economic Implications of Bond Yields

The assessment of bond yields involves dissecting them into two components: a risk-free rate, indicative solely of time preferences, and a risk premium encompassing any macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, and government liquidity constraints (Lo Conte, 2009:344). A nation exhibiting a higher risk profile requires that investors are compensated with a higher yield when purchasing government debt. Therefore, yields are often used as a proxy for the economic risk associated with a nation. At a different extreme, Manganelli & Wolswijk (2009:203) posit that two assets with identical cash flows should exhibit a zero yield spread if they have the same risk-return characteristics. 

When selecting a benchmark bond, a government security is a common selection (Lo Conte, 2009:341). This paper makes use of US Governments bonds as the relevant benchmark when calculating yield spreads. Many analysts consider these to be the world's *status-quo* store of value (He, Krishnamurthy, & Milbradt, 2016:519). Notably, a consistently high demand for US Treasury Bills has led to low yields historically (He *et al.*, 2016:519). In a fixed benchmark scenario, such as a yield spread analysis, variations in investor risk appetite become discernible over specific dates in the past decade. During risk-averse periods, the price of higher risk bonds will fall (in line with their value) and the yield will increase. Safer assets will likely see their value rise, and their yield decrease (Lo Conte, 2009:351). Manganelli & Wolswijk (2009:203) describe this time-varying risk aversion as a function of the economic climate, which is a common description in financial risk literature. 

As discussed in the previous section, the value, and therefore the price, of a bond is inversely related to the yield. Unlike the equities market, the appeal of the bond market lies in its role as a secure investment vehicle for institutional portfolios - particularly banks and low-risk funds. For example, a substantial bond allocation would be a prominent feature of the "safe asset portfolios" of central banks (He *et al.*, 2016:519). This is why a high-yield-bond is not as desired as a high-return-stock. 

The "safety" of an asset is often subjective and determined by investors. Safety is endogenous; the actions of investors can make a bond more stable than macroeconomic factors indicate (He *et al.*, 2016:523).  Lo Conte (2009:343) contends that the ratio of total government debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a robust measure of economic risk, significantly influencing EU bond yields, but this idea is not universally consistent. 

In the period spanning 2006-2016, US government debt surged, but this trend was not reflected in yields during that time (He et al., 2016:519). He *et al.* (2016:519) argue that, at the time, this was because investors did not feel as confident in the economic outlook for any developed nation as they did about the US. The analysis in this paper, which makes use of an updated data set spanning 2010-2023, will argue that investors are beginning to behave in a manner reflective of this additional risk. 

# Descriptive Statistics

This section is dedicated to discussing the interplay between bond yields and macro-economic indicators. In the landscape of economic indicators, particular attention is paid towards inflation, exchange rate volatility (specifically, US-EU dynamics), the Volatility Index (VIX), GDP Growth, and Debt to GDP ratios. The juxtaposition of bond yields with these indicators will explain the decisions made in the subsequent spread analysis, such as why the United States is the benchmark bond.

Commencing the descriptive analysis is a discussion on the significance of inflation, growth, and debt ratios as economic indicators correlated with 2-year bond yields. This discussion is facilitated by employing geo-spatial plots, which exhibit the average rate of each indicator for individual countries since 2010. While the use of decade-long averages provides a simplified perspective, one must acknowledge the time dynamics associated with these indicators. Consequently, a more granular examination is merited.

This temporal element is addressed by graphically representing bond yields for developing countries, developed nations, and BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa) countries since 2010. Accompanying these graphics are corresponding inflation trends during the same period. These plots include  blue regions denoting periods of high VIX, and red zones signifying increased US-EU exchange rate volatility. The choice of 2-year bond yields is crucial, as their shorter time to maturity means they are more sensitive to fluctuations in economic conditions.

Concluding the descriptive analysis, attention is directed towards the distribution of bond yields for each developed country and each BRICS nation. Analyzing these distributions is important for determining the susceptibility of different groups of nations to economic tail events, which sheds light on the resilience of economies against shocks.

## Geo-Spatial Analysis 

Yield differentials, especially in developing nations, cannot be entirely explained by discussing debt ratios or inflation rates. According to Lo Conte (2009:343), financial experts must consider the ability of a nation to meet debt obligations in U.S. dollars. This can occur through generating a trade surplus, or using foreign currency reserves. The geo-spatial analysis in this section emphasizes that no single macroeconomic factor perfectly determines bond yields.

In Figure 3.1, each country in the dataset is assigned a color to exhibit its ranking in a specific macroeconomic factor compared to other countries. For example, Venezuela consistently has the highest average bond yield since 2010, while Germany and Japan tend to have some of the lowest. Notably, Russia has a very low average debt ratio, but its bond yield has been among the highest. This seems less connected to traditional macroeconomic factors and more likely linked to geopolitical risk.
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average Macro-economic Indicators \\label{Figure3.1}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "55%", out.width = "100%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Full_Geo.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```
From these maps, one can posit that inflation holds significance for investors assessing government bond risk, given the observed similarity between high average inflation and high average bond yields. Although not universally applicable, this trend manifests in numerous cases. In contrast, the debt ratio appears disconnected from bond yields, as illustrated by Japan having the world's highest debt ratio but the lowest bond yield, and Nigeria possessing a similarly low debt ratio yet ranking among the nations with the highest average bond yields globally.

This finding is counter intuitive, but it can be attributed to the plots presenting all macroeconomic factors *in levels*. It is likely that if a nation unexpectedly accumulates more debt than anticipated by investors, this might adversely impact the risk level of the country. Additionally, there is likely a selection bias associated with this variable; countries perceived as more reliable accumulate more debt and higher ratios, given the expectation of debt repayment. In contrast, riskier countries may not be afforded the opportunity to accumulate substantial debt.

Furthermore, average GDP growth is an inadequate predictor of bond yields. South Africa exhibits notably low economic growth relative to other countries in the dataset. It also exhibits a high bond yield. If this were a determining factor, one would anticipate high bond yields from Germany, France, and the UK. However, these countries consistently exhibit some of the lowest bond yields globally, despite low growth rates. 

## Bond Yields 

In the period spanning from 1999 to the onset of the global financial crisis (GFC), there was a convergence in yield differentials among European Union (EU) member states. This was largely attributable to the the implementation of a common currency (Lo Conte, 2009:342). Consequently, the eradication of exchange rate risk left only credit and liquidity risk as determinants of yield differentials. Figure 3.2 displays the modern trend; there is still a similarity in the differentials between the bond yields of all developed nations in the data set, including EU nations. This trend contrasts with the erratic differentials observed among developing nations, as displayed in Figure 3.3. 

Developed nations continue to exhibit similar trends during periods of crisis, including the 2013 episode of substantial exchange rate volatility, as well as elevated VIX levels observed in 2020. Additionally, a homogeneous escalation in bond yields is observed during the alarming inflation witnessed in 2021. A notable observation pertaining to the risk of developing nations as a broad group is the confined range of these bond yields, which consistently fluctuate between being slightly negative values, and 4%. This stands in contrast to the varied patterns observed with the yields of developing nations. Furthermore, there exists a co-movement between bond yields and inflation in the developed world. This co-movement emphasizes the diminished effect of other economic risk factors on bond yields in developed economies.
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yields of Developed Nations \\label{Figure3.2}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "53%", out.width = "80%"}

                         dpi = 300)

```
In the 1980s, emerging economies had a low presence in the market for the issuance of debt (3.5 billion dollars in 1989). However, this changed rapidly, with the levels of debt issued reaching 102 billion dollars by 1996 (Lo Conte, 2009:342).As seen in Figure 3.3., the trend of debt issuance by developing countries has persisted to 2023. The figure lacks the bond yields of Venezuela and Mexico. The exclusion of these nations is due to decisions by the respective governments that were perceived adversely by investors. This means that the short-term bond yields of Venezuela and Mexico require a unique scale to visualize, because of the considerable impact of the unfavorable investor sentiments resulting from these decisions.
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yields of Developing Nations \\label{Figure3.3}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "53%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Developing_Bonds_Yields.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```
Certain developing nations do exhibit relatively low yields, such as Bulgaria, where the 2-year bond yield has been negative since 2016. Although classified as an upper-middle-income country by the World Bank (World Bank, 2022), Bulgaria has a financial history reflecting a commitment to meeting debt obligations. Russia, alongside most members of the BRICS consortium, shares the classification of upper-middle-income according to the World Bank (World Bank, 2022). However, Russia's bond yields diverge significantly from that of Bulgaria. This is unsurprising given Russia's involvement in two international conflicts within the past decade.
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yields of BRICS Nations \\label{Figure3.4}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "53%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/BRICS_Bonds_Yields.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```
BRICS nations presently lack uniformity in bond yields. Furthermore, the bond yields of these countries do not demonstrate a strong synchronization with inflation. While inflation remains a risk factor in BRICS nations, they also contend with substantial exposure to exchange rate volatility, geopolitical uncertainties, and liquidity risks. Inflation, in the overall risk profile of BRICS bond yields is proportionally smaller than it is in the risk profile of developed nations.

## Yield Distributions 

here, argue why the US is the de facto benchmark. 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yield Distributions of Developed Nations \\label{Figure3.5}", out.height = "50%", out.width = "90%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Developed_Distributions.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yield Distributions of BRICS Nations \\label{Figure3.6}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "90%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/BRICS_Distributions.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

# Yield Spreads 

## Developed Nations

Liquidity, it is claimed by practitioners, is the main source of the residual segmentation among European government bonds, but the evidence does not fully support this view (Lo Conte, 2009:366). 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Developed World Bond Yield Spreads \\label{Figure4.1}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "80%"}

                         dpi = 300)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "South Africa vs Germany Yield Spread \\label{Figure4.2}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "45%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/SA-Germany.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

## BRICS Nations 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "BRICS Bond Yield Spreads \\label{Figure4.3}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/BRICS_Spreads.png",
