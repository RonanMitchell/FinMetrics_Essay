## The Calculation of Bond Yield

The assessment of bond profitability differs markedly from the evaluation of equities and other risky assets. Financial practitioners often use the term "yield" in order to contextualize bond performance. This can take various forms; Current Yield, Yield-to-Call, Yield-to-Worst, and Yield-to-Maturity (YTM). The widely adopted practice in finance involves employing YTM to calculate yield spreads, as is the case in this paper. In Lawrence & Shankar (2007:92), the relationship between a bond price and YTM is calculated as: 

\[ P = \frac{C}{(1+i)} + \frac{C}{(1+i)^2} + \ldots + \frac{M}{(1+i)^n} \]

In the above equation, *P* is the price of the given bond, *C* is the coupon rate, *M* is the principal payment, and *i* - which can be inferred - is the YTM. From this, it can be concluded that, *ceteris paribus*, there is an inverse relationship between the price of a bond and the YTM. A core assumption of this formula is that the bond buyer will hold until maturity and reinvest each interest payment at the same rate. It is simply an estimate of what one should earn from purchasing a bond. The YTM is often approximated as:

\[ YTM \approx \frac{C + \frac{FV - PV}{n}}{\frac{FV + PV}{2}} \]

In this case, the *FV* is the face value of the security and the *PV* would be the present value or price of the security. This equation once again demonstrates the inverse relationship between the price and YTM of a bond. This relationship is a useful indicator when attempting to understand the level of risk that a bond has. The yield is used to differentiate between the risk profiles of two or more bonds.  

## The Economic Implications of Bond Yields

The assessment of bond yields involves dissecting them into two components: a risk-free rate, indicative solely of time preferences, and a risk premium encompassing any macroeconomic factors, such as inflation, exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, and government liquidity constraints (Lo Conte, 2009:344). A nation exhibiting a higher risk profile requires that investors are compensated with a higher yield when purchasing government debt. Therefore, yields are often used as a proxy for the economic risk associated with a nation. At a different extreme, Manganelli & Wolswijk (2009:203) posit that two assets with identical cash flows should exhibit a zero yield spread if they have the same risk-return characteristics. 

When selecting a benchmark bond, a government security is a common selection (Lo Conte, 2009:341). This paper makes use of US Governments bonds as the relevant benchmark when calculating yield spreads, because many analysts consider these to be the world's *status-quo* store of value (He, Krishnamurthy, & Milbradt, 2016:519). Notably, a consistently high demand for US Treasury Bills has led to low yields historically (He *et al.*, 2016:519). In a fixed benchmark scenario, such as a yield spread analysis, variations in investor risk appetite become discernible over specific dates in the past decade. During risk-averse periods, the price of risky bonds will fall (in line with their value) and their yield will increase. Safer assets will likely see their value rise, and their yield decrease (Lo Conte, 2009:351). Manganelli & Wolswijk (2009:203) describe this time-varying risk aversion as a function of the economic climate, which is a common description in financial risk literature. 

Unlike the equities market, the appeal of the bond market lies in its role as a secure investment vehicle for institutional portfolios - particularly banks and low-risk funds. For example, a substantial bond allocation is a prominent feature of the "safe asset portfolios" of central banks (He *et al.*, 2016:519). The "safety" of an asset is often subjective and determined by investors. Safety is endogenous; the actions of investors can make a bond more stable than macroeconomic factors indicate (He *et al.*, 2016:523).  Lo Conte (2009:343) contends that the ratio of total government debt to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a robust measure of economic risk, significantly influencing EU bond yields, but this idea is not universally consistent. 

In the period spanning 2006-2016, US government debt surged, but this trend was not reflected in yields during that time (He et al., 2016:519). He *et al.* (2016:519) argue that, at the time, this was because investors did not feel as confident in the economy of any developed nation as they did about the US economy. The analysis in this paper, which makes use of an updated data set spanning 2010-2023, will argue that investors are beginning to behave in a manner reflective of this additional risk. 

# Descriptive Statistics

## Bond Yields 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yields of Developed Nations \\label{Figure1.1}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "53%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Developed_Bond_Yields.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

Yield differentials among members of the EU have converged
dramatically since 1999 although they have not completely disappeared. The
introduction of the common currency in 1999 eliminated the exchange rate
risk component of the spreads leaving credit risk and liquidity risk as the on-ly residual sources of market segmentation (Lo Conte, 342:2009). 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yields of Developing Nations \\label{Figure1.2}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "53%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Developing_Bonds_Yields.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

The surge of sovereign bond issues in emerging economies has been impressive. From negligible levels in 1980s ($3.5 billion in 1989), the amount
of bonds issued by developing countries reached $102 billion in 1996 (Lo Conte, 2009:342). 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yields of BRICS Nations \\label{Figure1.3}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "53%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/BRICS_Bonds_Yields.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

## Yield Distributions 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yield Distributions of Developed Nations \\label{Figure2.1}", out.height = "50%", out.width = "90%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Developed_Distributions.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Bond Yield Distributions of BRICS Nations \\label{Figure2.2}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "90%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/BRICS_Distributions.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

## Geo-Spatial Analysis 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average Bond Yield and Inflation \\label{Figure3.1}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "90%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Geospatial_1.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

Inflation or debt-to-GDP, for example, would not explain fully yield differentials in developing regions bonds. In particular, correct measurement of credit risk needs to quantify the extent to which a developing country is able to meet payments in U.S. dollars either via generation of trade surplus or
through the use of its foreign currency reserves. (Lo Conte, 2009:343). 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Average GDP Growth \\label{Figure3.2}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Geospatial_2.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

# Yield Spreads 

## Developed Nations

Liquidity, it is claimed by practitioners, is the main source of the residual segmentation among European government bonds, but the evidence does not fully support this view (Lo Conte, 2009:366). 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "Developed World Bond Yield Spreads \\label{Figure4.1}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/Developed_Spreads.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "South Africa vs Germany Yield Spread \\label{Figure4.2}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "45%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/SA-Germany.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

## BRICS Nations 

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "BRICS Bond Yield Spreads \\label{Figure4.3}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "50%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/BRICS_Spreads.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "SA vs China Yield Spread \\label{Figure4.4}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "45%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/SA-China.png", 
                         dpi = 300)

```

```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, fig.align = 'center', fig.cap = "SA vs India Yield Spread \\label{Figure4.5}", fig.ext = 'png', out.height = "45%", out.width = "80%"}

knitr::include_graphics("Images/SA-India.png", 
                         dpi = 300)
